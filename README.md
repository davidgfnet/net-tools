=========

Network Tools for hacking purposes

 * arp-flood: A tool that will flood the net with many ARP packets with
   random src MAC addrs. This fools most switches into becoming a hub
   temporarily.
 * arp-dos: A tool that will inject fake ARP responses into the network
   via broadcast to announce a fake MAC addr for the desired IP (usually
   gateway) so that communication with that endpoint is not possible.
